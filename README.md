Ocean temperature plotting of data using R. <br />
Data source: AIMS https://www.aims.gov.au/docs/data/data.html. Subset of "temp-logger.csv". <br />
Sampling location: Bramble Cay, QLD, AU. <br />
Data is located in data.zip. <br />
Run the R code file with the data file supplied. Two plots will appear (below). These are the raw water temperature measurements. <br />
There are multiple temperature measurement samples taken per day, hence the vertical stacking of points in the below plots.
