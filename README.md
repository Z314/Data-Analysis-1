# Data-Visualisation-1

Ocean temperature plotting of data using R. <br />
Based on Australian Institute of Marine Science data source: https://www.aims.gov.au/docs/data/data.html. Subset of "temp-logger.csv". <br />
Sampling location: Bramble Cay, QLD, AU. <br />
Data is located in data.zip. <br />
Run the R code file with the data file supplied. Two plots will appear (below). These are the raw water temperature measurements. <br />
There are multiple temperature measurement samples taken per day, hence the vertical stacking of points in the below plots.

The below uses R to plot temperatures in Townsville (line graphs with regression line). Four months of each year are plotted.<br />
Data source: BOM http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/data/index.shtml?bookmark=200.<br />
Data file name: townsville_temp_BOM.xlsx.<br />
Plot of Townsville Temperatures: The Monthly mean maximum temperatures from 1940 to 2019.<br />
Line plots of raw data and also regression lines for four months of the year.<br />
